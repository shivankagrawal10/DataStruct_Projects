# DataStruct_Projects
Five practical application projects completed in Data Structures class (CS112)

1. Polynomial: given polynomial expressions, can add like terms, multiply polynomials, and evaluate for given x
(Linked Lists)

2. Expression Evaluator: Alternative approach to evaluating expressions using order of operations (different from classic stack approach) 
(Powerful application of recursion)

3. Trie: Organizes list of words into a tree where prefixes are parent branches, reduces and enables search for all words in list with similar beginning ( ex. box, bond, bowl, band, if search bo --> returns box, bond, bowl)
(Tree)

4. Little Search Engine: Use of REGEX to create a hash table of keywords in multiple input texts for potential use in frequency analysis
(hash tables and hash sets)

5. Friends: uses depth first, breadth first searching to determine shortest path between two members in friends network, which members are the connectors, and lists members of same school in direct contact with each other (cliques)
(Graphs and hash table)
